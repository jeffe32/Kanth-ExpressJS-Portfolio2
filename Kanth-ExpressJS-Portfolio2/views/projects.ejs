      <h4>1. Introductory to Calculus - Assignment 1</h4>
      <p>
        This assignment was about the introduction to fundamental concepts of
        calculus, functions, exponential growth, logarithmic equations, and
        graph transformations. It strengthened our problem-solving skills through
        multiple-choice, true/false, and analytical questions.

      <h4>2. Computer Architecture - Assignment 1</h4>
      <p>
        This assignment explored computer system structures and operations with
        a focus on memory hierarchy, CPU functions, and MIPS assembly
        programming. It applied both theoretical understanding and practical coding
        to analyze performance and execution.
